Javascript Exercises
1. What is the difference between the following 2 statements?
    
    setTimeout(booyah, 2000);
    setTimeout(booyah(), 2000);
    
- setTimeout(booyah, 2000): calls the function after waiting 2000ms, and repeat after 200ms
- setTimeout(booyah(), 2000): calls the function immediately, rather than waiting 2000ms and only call one time

2. What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)?
    
    var myfunc = function(a, x) {
    return a * x;
    };
    var x = myfunc(2, 3);
    var y = myfunc;
    alert(x);
    alert(y(2,3)); 
    
- The following 2 alerts display 6

3. Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up after 2 seconds that says “BOOYAH!”
    setTimeout(booyah1, 2000);
    setTimeout(booyah2(), 2000);

- function booyah1() {
    alert('BOOYAH!');
}

- function booyah2() {
    return function() { 
        alert('BOOYAH!');

4. What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons for using it)?
- Unobtrusive javascript promotes separation of web page content into 3 different concerns:
content (HTML), presentation (CSS), and behavior(JS) (ala MVC, knower, known, process of knowing)
The practical:
- HTML with minimal JavaScript inside
- uses the DOM to attach and execute all JavaScript functions
- separates structure and behaviour, in order to make your code cleaner and script maintenance easier
- pre-empts browser incompatibilities
- works with a clean, semantic HTML layer
