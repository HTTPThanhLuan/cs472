Note:
If you install Mysql 8.0, you can face with a driver connector problem from java to mysql.

this is error "java.sql.SQLException: Access denied for user ''@'localhost' (using password: YES) to mysql 8.0"

The driver connector that I put in Lib folder, you will copy it and paste in lib folder of tomcat.
 
and then write code like I wrote in Db.java
