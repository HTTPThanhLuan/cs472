Javascript Scope Exercises

1. Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it): 
        x = 1; var a = 5; var b = 10; 
        var c = function(a, b, c)
         {
         var x = 10; 
        document.write(x); 
        document.write(a); 
        var f = function(a, b, c) { 
        b = a; 
        document.write(b); 
        b = c; 
        var x = 5; } 
        f(a,b,c); 
        document.write(b); 
        } 
        c(8,9,10); 
        document.write(b); 
        document.write(x); } 
        =>output :  10 , 8, 8, 10 , 10, 1

2. What is the difference between a method and function? 
    => a method and function are the same meaning, scope is what you should be focusing on, not the sematic of function vs method. The context of this within the function/ method is the key. 

3. What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?
    => in java this works as a reference to the current Object, whose method is being invoked 

4. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method? 
    => In a method, this refers to the owner object.

5. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function? 
    =>In a constructor function this does not have a value. It is a substitute for the new object. The value of this will become the new object when a new object is created.

6. Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method f( ) containing keyword 'this'. When f is called by x.f( ), what does 'this' refer to? 
    =>this refer to object x

7. What is a free variable in JavaScript? 
    => A variable referred to by a function that is not one of its parameters or local variables.

8. Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music" and a property that is a function that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, or the square of the two if they are equal. 
        var obj = {
        name: "fred",
        major: "music",
        compute : function(x,y){
          if(x!=y) return x < y ? x:y;
          else return x*y;
         }
        }
        
9. Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects using the "new" keyword and a constructor function. Employee objects have the following fields: name, salary, position.
        function Employee(name, salary, position) 
        { this. name = name;
         this. salary = salary; 
        this. Position= position;
        }
        Var emp1 = new Employee("Tom",2000,"Manager");
        Var emp2 = new Employee("David",1000,"Staff");
        Var emp3 = new Employee("Peter",2000,"Staff");
		
10.  Write a Javascript function that takes any number of input arguments and returns the product of the arguments. 
     function name(){
	     var product=1;
		for(let i=0; i<arguments.length; i++) {
		   product*=arguments[i];
		}
		return product;
	 }
	 
11.  Write an arrow function that returns the maximum of its three input arguments.
     
	var a=(x,y,z)=> { 
			var max=x;
			if(y>max)
			   max=y;
			if(z> max)
			   max=z;
			   
			   return max;
	   }
